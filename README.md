# Dominion: a boardgame.io test

This is a sample project testing the boardgame.io for creating a computer version of a board game. I selected Dominion, because I have it, I know the game and I can select simple cards to test and evolve the game.

# How to try

This game is very very incomplete but if you want to try...

First you have to clone the code:

```
git clone https://github.com/janosimas/dominion
```

get into the folder and install the dependencies
```
npm install
```

run the code
```
npm start
```

Now you can go to `localhost:3000` and check it out.
